/**
 * Quicksort.
 * Quicksortis a divide-and-conquer method for sorting. It works by partitioning an array into two parts,
 * then sorting the parts independently. The crux of the method is the partitioning process,
 * which rearranges the array to make the following three conditions hold:
 * 1. The entry a[j] is in its final place in the array, for some j.
 * 2. No entry in a[lo] through a[j-1] is greater than a[j].
 * 3. No entry in a[j+1] through a[hi] is less than a[j].
 * We achieve a complete sort by partitioning, then recursively applying the method to the subarrays.
 * It is a randomized algorithm, because it randomly shuffles the array before sorting it.
 * <p>
 * Partitioning.
 * To complete the implementation, we need to implement the partitioning method. We use the following general strategy:
 * First, we arbitrarily choose a[lo] to be the partitioning itemâ€”the one that will go into its final position.
 * Next, we scan from the left end of the array until we find an entry that is greater than (or equal to) the
 * partitioning item, and we scan from the right end of the array until we find an entry less than (or equal to)
 * the partitioning item.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Proposition. Quicksort uses ~2 N ln N compares (and one-sixth that many exchanges)
 * on the average to sort an array of length N with distinct keys.
 * </p>
