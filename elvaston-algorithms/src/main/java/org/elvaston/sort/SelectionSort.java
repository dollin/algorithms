/**
 * Selection Sort.
 * One of the simplest sorting algorithms that works as follows:
 * First, find the smallest item in the array, and exchange it with the first entry. Then, find the next smallest
 * item and exchange it with the second entry. Continue in this way until the entire array is sorted.
 * This method is called selection sort because it works by repeatedly selecting the smallest remaining item.
 * <p>
 * Proposition: Selection sort uses ~(N^2)/2 compares and n exchanges to sort an array of length N.
