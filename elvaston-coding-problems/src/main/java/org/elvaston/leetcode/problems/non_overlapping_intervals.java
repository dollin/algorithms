/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/
 *
 * Given a collection of intervals, find the MINIMUM number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
 *
 * Note:
 * You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
 * Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.
 *
 * Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
 *
 * Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
 *
 * Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
